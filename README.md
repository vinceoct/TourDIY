TourDIY is a full-stack web application designed to simplify the process of booking tours for artists and bands across the U.S. The app utilizes the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.js), Sequelize as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library, and Bootstrap for responsive and user-friendly frontend design. With BandVenueFinder, artists and bands can sign up or log in to explore local venues and bands in different cities, making the tour booking process more efficient and seamless.

## Features
User Authentication: Artists and bands can sign up or log in to the platform, allowing them to access personalized features and data.

Band Database: When an artist or band signs up, their information is securely stored in the database, making them discoverable by others using the platform.

Venue and Band Discovery: Users can browse through a comprehensive database of local venues and bands across the United States, making it easier to plan and book tours.

City Database: If a city where a band is based is not already in the database during signup, the city information is automatically added to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## Tech Stack
The following technologies were used to develop BandVenueFinder:

Frontend: The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Bootstrap is utilized for responsive and visually appealing designs.

Backend: The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, providing a fast and scalable server environment.

Database: PostgreSQL is used as the relational database to store user information, bands, venues, and cities.

ORM: Sequelize is employed as the ORM library, enabling seamless interaction with the database.

## Usage
Register/Login: If you are a new artist or band, register your account. If you are an existing user, log in to access your personalized dashboard.

Explore Bands and Venues: Use the search and filter functionalities to explore bands and venues in different cities across the U.S.

Add Band Information: After registering, make sure to provide comprehensive information about your band to enhance your discoverability by others.

Discover New Cities: If your city is not already in the database, it will be automatically added when you sign up.

## Coming Soon
We'll soon be adding the ability for bands and artists to add venue information to the database.
